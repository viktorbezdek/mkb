# ADR-005: Confidence Scoring as First-Class Citizen

**Decision:** Every fact has a confidence score (0.0–1.0). Queries can filter by confidence.

**Rationale:**
- Mixed provenance: some facts from Jira API (high confidence), some from
  AI inference on slack messages (lower confidence)
- LLMs consuming this data need to know what to trust
- Enables progressive trust: signals start low-confidence, gain confidence
  through corroboration
- Users can set thresholds: "only show me signals above 0.8"

**Scoring factors:** source reliability × extraction method × corroboration × freshness × specificity
