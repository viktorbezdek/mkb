# ADR-008: Source Adapters as Pluggable Transforms

**Decision:** Each external source (Jira, Slack, etc.) gets a transform script
that maps source data to MKB schemas.

**Rationale:**
- Every organization's Jira setup is different — custom fields, workflows, naming
- Transforms are plain Python scripts, easy to customize and version
- New sources can be added without modifying core engine
- Transform scripts are testable in isolation
- Community can share transform templates

**Pattern:**

```
Source API → Raw JSON → Transform Script → MKB Document(s) → Vault
```
