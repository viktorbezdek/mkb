# ADR-003: Why SQLite for Field Index (Not Postgres, DuckDB, or Custom)

**Decision:** SQLite with FTS5 extension as the field index backend.

**Rationale:**
- Zero configuration, embedded, single-file database
- FTS5 provides excellent full-text search with ranking
- Handles millions of documents comfortably
- Well-understood query optimizer
- Available everywhere (even on phones)
- Perfect for single-user / small-team use case

**When to graduate:** If MKB needs multi-user concurrent writes or >10M docs,
consider Postgres with pgvector. But start simple.
