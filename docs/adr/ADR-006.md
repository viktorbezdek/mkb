# ADR-006: Implicit Signals as a Schema Type

**Decision:** AI-inferred knowledge gets its own document type (`signal`) rather
than being annotations on existing docs.

**Rationale:**
- Signals have their own lifecycle: detected → corroborated → acknowledged → resolved
- Multiple signals can reference the same entity from different angles
- Signals can be wrong — separate storage makes cleanup easy
- Query patterns differ: "show me all risk signals" vs "show me project details"
- Confidence evolution: signals gain/lose confidence over time independently

**Anti-pattern avoided:** Mixing AI inference into the same document as source
facts makes it impossible to distinguish what was stated vs what was inferred.
