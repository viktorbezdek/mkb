# ADR-004: Why Rust Core + Python AI Layer

**Decision:** Core engine (parser, indexer, CLI, file watcher) in Rust.
AI pipeline (LLM calls, embeddings, extraction) in Python.

**Rationale:**
- Rust: fast file operations, reliable CLI, zero-cost abstractions for parsing
- Python: best LLM SDK ecosystem (anthropic, openai, langchain, sentence-transformers)
- Clear boundary: Rust handles I/O-bound + CPU-bound work, Python handles AI inference
- Communication: Python subprocess or Unix socket for AI calls from Rust CLI

**Alternative considered:** All Python. Rejected because MKQL parser + index
operations benefit significantly from Rust performance, and CLI startup time
matters for interactive use.
