# ADR-001: Why File-System Native

**Decision:** Every knowledge unit is a markdown file. No database is the source of truth.

**Rationale:**
- Git-native: full history, branching, merging, blame, diff — for free
- Human-readable: any editor, any OS, no special tooling required
- LLM-friendly: markdown is the lingua franca of every foundation model
- Portable: cp, rsync, tar — works everywhere
- Debuggable: when something breaks, you can just read the file
- Vendor-free: no database migrations, no schema lock-in, no service to run

**Trade-offs:**
- Slower queries than a native DB → mitigated by SQLite index layer
- No ACID transactions across files → mitigated by git commits as atomic units
- Duplicate data (files + indexes) → indexes are derived, rebuildable from files

**Index is cache, files are truth.** `mkb index rebuild` regenerates everything from vault files.
